Blockstarter is a crowdfunding blockchain application built on the Sepolia testnet. It allows users to create and fund campaigns securely through individual smart contracts. This decentralized platform ensures that all transactions are safe, trustworthy, and transparent.

## Features

- **Create Campaigns**: Anyone can create a campaign, setting the funding goal, duration, and campaign details.
- **Fund Campaigns**: Users can contribute to any campaign, with each contribution recorded on the blockchain.
- **Edit Campaigns**: Campaign owners can update the campaign details after creation.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Each campaign is associated with an individual smart contract, ensuring secure handling of funds.
- **Fund Safety**: Campaign owners cannot withdraw funds directly. They must create a request, and contributors vote to approve or reject the withdrawal.
- **Voting System**: Contributors have the power to vote on withdrawal requests, making the funding process democratic and transparent.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard showcases the top contributors for each campaign, promoting engagement and competition.
- **Campaign Closure**: Campaigns close automatically when the timer ends or when the funding goal is reached.
- **Investment Tracking**: Users can view all the campaigns they have contributed to under the "My Investments" tab.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on all devices, providing a great user experience.
